It is with great pleasure that we recognize [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/), a cross-platform
voice-control application, as the first end user application to
implement AccessKit! Current Windows and Mac beta builds of Talon have
had their app core ported from QT to Egui, thereby adopting AccessKit. Linux support is coming soon pending a bug fix.

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the Talon developers for
integrating AccessKit into their project.

Users can currently obtain an accessible beta build of Talon via their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs).
