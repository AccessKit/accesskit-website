I recently gave a presentation at [RustConf 2023](https://rustconf.com/schedule/making-guis-accessible-across-platforms-and-languages-with-rust). This presentation discusses making graphical user interfaces (GUIs) accessible across platforms and programming languages with Rust, by way of the AccessKit project. The presentation will feature demonstrations of what currently works, and further discuss how the community can get involved.

The recording of this presentation will be posted shortly. I would like to thank RustConf for the opportunity to present, and look forward to what the future holds.
