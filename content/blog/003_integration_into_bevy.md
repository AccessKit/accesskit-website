[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), a popular game engine for the Rust programming language, just released version 0.10, with built-in AccessKit integration. As [Bevy’s own announcement](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#accesskit-integration-into-bevy-ui) says, this makes Bevy the first general-purpose game engine with first-party accessibility support.

This is just the start of the journey toward enabling fully accessible games with Bevy; you can read more about what still needs to be done in the announcement linked above. Still, we’d like to thank the Bevy core team members, as well as [Nolan Darilek](https://github.com/ndarilek), for working with us to reach this milestone. We look forward to continuing to work with Nolan and the Bevy core team to make first-class accessible games a reality.
